# Introduction to Git and Github

### This file will be available for everyone to view the basic in's and out's of working with Git

## General

Git is a type of Version Control System (VCS), which basically means that it
keeps track of everything you do. Then, if we screw something up we can 
revert to the previous version when it actually worked.

For all intents and purposes, Git also works as a sort of cloud system. We
can use it as a place to store all our files like iCloud or Azure. This then
lets us work on the same project at the same time, across multiple computers.

GitHub is just a collection of servers that allow this to happen. The site
also gives us several team management functions as well as a nice UI to use
Git (which was originally intended for the command line only).

Throughout the course of the semester we will be using Github to manage the
source code of our project. This includes submitting bug reports and feature
requests, as well as communicating between teammates about more 
project-specific topics within the code itself.
