# To make sure that unity scenes merge automatically, change the name of this file

# Unity YAML Merge file, which automatically merges scenes.

# In Unity for Windows, find your Unity version folder and go to:
# Editor -> Data -> Tools -> UnityYAMLMerge.exe OR
# Editor\Data\Tools\UnityYAMLMerge.exe

# In Unity for MacOS, find your Unity version folder and go to:
# Unity.app -> Contents -> Tools -> UnityYAMLMerge OR
# Unity.app/Contents/Tools/UnityYAMLMerge

# Remember, you need to copy the WHOLE path. If you don't know what this is,
# I'll explain it to you. Also, please COPY this file before commiting
