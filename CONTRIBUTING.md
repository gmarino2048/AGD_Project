# Contributing Rules

## Committing

### Communication

**All updates to the master branch will be announced in the `file-updates`
channel on discord.**

If you have changes that need to be made to the master branch, you will need
to submit a pull request. **When you submit a pull request, please announce
it in the `file-updates` channel.**

If you want to make changes to another person's code or assets, be sure to 
let them know. You can create a new branch to modify their code, or you can
submit an issue and tag them in the issue.

### Branch Conventions

Any work you do should be on a separate branch from `master`. Commits
directly to the `master` branch should be reserved for **team leads only**.
This is to prevent confusion as our project gets more and more complex. Even
then, team leads must create an announcement every time the master branch is
updated.

The master branch is locked. This means that it cannot be modified by anyone
without first undergoing a pull request review. **If you have an important
branch that you would like to lock, you should be able to edit the branch
settings yourself.**

If you would like to update a file, you need to create and checkout a new
branch. **All the work that you do on this branch should go towards the same
general goal.** For example, if you want to update the contributing rules you
should checkout a new branch, modify this file, and then submit a pull 
request.
